### ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

1. Install requirements.txt file using
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### ðŸ“‚ Datasets

We have used publicly available datasets. The source of the datasets are:

| Dataset      | Language      | Source                                      |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Hate Codemix | Hindi-English | [Link](https://github.com/deepanshu1995/HateSpeech-Hindi-English-Code-Mixed-Social-Media-Text) |
| HASOC 2019 | English       | [Link](https://hasocfire.github.io/hasoc/2019/dataset.html) |
| HateCheckHIn   | Hindi         | [Link](https://github.com/hate-alert/HateCheckHIn)          |


### ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get results of models on Hatespeech_Codemix data directly run the file like this:

```
python3 Main_results/{model}.py
```

### Experiments

#### Experiment 1

1. Hate and Non-hate samples are 1416 each of Hatespeech_English(new) and
Hatespeech_Hindi which is then combined with Hatespeech_Codemix.


To get results directly run the file like this:

``` 
python3 Main_results/{model}.py
```

2. Hate and Non-hate samples in Hatespeech_English(new) and Hatespeech_Hindi are
in the same ratio(Maximum possible samples) as Hatespeech_Codemix.

To get results directly run the file like this:

```
python3 Main_results/{model}.py
```

#### Experiment 2


1. Incremental Mixing: A batch of 200 samples of Hate and Non-hate class each from
English and Hindi datasets were mixed along with Codemix data. We have then tried a
sample size of 400,600,800,1000,1200,1400.

To get results directly run the file like this:

```
python3 Experiment2/{model}.py
```

These codes are default for 200 samples. For different sample sizes required lines are
commented in the code.



2. Label Ratio Mixing: A batch of 200 samples each from English and Hindi datasets in
which Hate and Non-hate class is present in the same ratio as in Codemix data were
mixed along with Codemix data.We have then tried a sample size of
400,600,800,1000,1200,1400.
   
To get results directly run the file like this:

```
python3 Experiment2/{model}.py
```

These codes are default for 200 samples of Hindi and English dataset. For different
sample sizes required lines are commented in the code.




#### Experiment 3
Here the training sets consisted solely of Hindi and English combined samples, only
English samples(only code-mix validation set) and only Hindi samples(only code-mix
validation set). Samples were taken in an incremental way like part 1 of Experiment 2.
Here codes for the highest possible sample size is given. For different sample sizes
required lines are commented in the code.



1. Mixed Validation Set: Comprises Hindi and English samples similar to training set.
   
To get results directly run the file like this:

```
python3 Experiment3/{model}.py
```

2. Codemix Validation Set: Using the original Codemix validation set.
   
To get results directly run the file like this:

```
python3 Experiment3/{model}.py
```

abstract = {Hate detection has long been a challenging task for the NLP community. The task becomes complex in a code-mixed environment because the models must understand the context and the hate expressed through language alteration. Compared to the monolingual setup, we see much less work on code-mixed hate as large-scale annotated hate corpora are unavailable for the study. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose using native language hate samples (native language samples/ native samples hereafter). We hypothesise that in the era of multilingual language models (MLMs), hate in code-mixed settings can be detected by majorly relying on the native language samples. Even though the NLP literature reports the effectiveness of MLMs on hate detection in many cross-lingual settings, their extensive evaluation in a code-mixed scenario is yet to be done. This paper attempts to fill this gap through rigorous empirical experiments. We considered the Hindi-English code-mixed setup as a case study as we have the linguistic expertise for the same. Some of the interesting observations we got are: (i) adding native hate samples in the code-mixed training set, even in small quantity, improved the performance of MLMs for code-mixed hate detection, (ii) MLMs trained with native samples alone observed to be detecting code-mixed hate to a large extent, (iii) the visualisation of attention scores revealed that, when native samples were included in training, MLMs could better focus on the hate emitting words in the code-mixed context, and (iv) finally, when hate is subjective or sarcastic, naively mixing native samples doesnâ€™t help much to detect code-mixed hate. We have released the data and code repository to reproduce the reported results.},
